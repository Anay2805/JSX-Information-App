             Q1. What is JSX and React Native ?
         </b>
         <br>
         <br>

         A1. Engineers at Facebook, while working on designing the different complex Facebook apps,
         realized that the declarative style of coding would make their app organization easy.
        <br>  
        <br>
        They developed a new programming language called JSX and a new mobile development
        framework called React Native to help build powerful and complex apps in an easy way.
        <br>
        <br>
        JSX combines both HTML and Javascript style of coding. JSX is declarative - we tell what are
        the different components we want in the application.We wrote JSX and React Native code in an online editor called 'Snack'
        <br>

            Q2. What is 'Snack'?
        </b>
        <br>
        <br>

        A2. Snack is an online editor written by Expo, which allows us to write and compile React
        Native code in an online environment. We can also preview the output of the code using
        'Snack'.

        <br>
        <br>

        On the left side, you see all the files in the project.  We will look into these files later.
        <br><br>
        At the centre, you see the workspace where we will write our code.
        <br><br>On the right side, you can see the output of your code. You can see the output for either Android, iOS or Web
        </p>

        <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;">

        For Android/iOS, you can see the output either on your phone or on the android emulator in
        the browser. (By clicking Run on your device.)
        <br>
        <br>
        For Android/iOS, you can install Expo Client, sign in with the same account and open the
        project from under Projects Tab.
        <br>
        <br>
        For Android, you can also scan the QR Code.
        (I encourage to scan the QR code from your Expo App and check the output.)
        <br>
        <br>
        For seeing the output on the device emulator in the browser, you have to press "Tap to
        play". You might have to wait in a queue as there are many systems online using a common
        emulator.
